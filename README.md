# Raspberry_Pi_Skype_SecurityAlarm
Home Security system like ADT needs to renew registration at police station and pay each month. This is a Raspberry Pi project that tries to accomplish the same goal at much lower cost. 1. using pyro IR detector to trigger GPIO pins on Raspberry Pi. Nearly no false alarm. 2.  Raspberry Pi is power-up to arm, and power-off to disarm, by a wireless outlet switch. 3. A Windows PC runs a web service to receive the alarm, calls Skype API (well maintained by Microsoft), then Skype sends IM (very fast, 3sec delay) to cellphone. By checking home cameras, the user can decide to call police.
